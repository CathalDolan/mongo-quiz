        <h3 class="center-align">The quick and easy way to create quizzes for friends and family</h3>
        <p>Mongo Quiz is designed as a bit of social fun to be played among friends and family.
            It is played in real-time, meaning everyone plays at the same time. We suggest using 
            two devices, one to allow the Quiz Master and players to communicate with each other 
            (using platforms* such as Zoom, Skype or Hangouts), and a second where the game is 
            played.</p>
        <p>The Quiz Master creates the quiz, deciding on how many rounds, the subject of each,
            the number of questions per round, and the difficulty of each question. When all 
            players are ready, the Quiz Master publishes the quiz and begins to launch/ask the
            questions one by one. As the questions are asked, they become visible to each player.
            You will be given 4 possible options and 20 seconds to answer. When everyone has
            answered the question, the Quiz Master will launch the next, and so on until all
            questions have been asked and rounds played.</p>
        <p>At the end of each round the Quiz Master will publish the scores. Players will be
        able to see where they rank in each round and overall, as well as seeing everyoneâ€™s
        scores.</p>

        <p id="div_note">*Please note, Mongo quiz does not incorporate any communication platforms and can
            be played just as well without. However, it's much more fun is you can see each 
            other!</p>
