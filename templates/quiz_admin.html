        <p>Being Quiz Master is so simple. Click the “Publish” button to launch the quiz. 
        When everyone is ready, launch the first question. When all teams have answered 
        it, launch the next question and so on until each question in each category have 
        been asked.</p>
        <p> Keep an eye on how each team is doing in the “Scores” tab. At the end of each 
        round update the scores so that everyone can see them. Create a bit of excitement 
        by calling out the top three in advance!</p>
